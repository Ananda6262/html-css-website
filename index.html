        <p>VCV Rack is a free open-source virtual modular synthesizer: multiple modules can be connected to synthesize a sound.
          By default the software contains several VCOs, LFOs, mixers, and other standard synthesizer modules, however more can
          be added as plugins through the VCV Rack website.</p>

        <h3>Digital Art</h3>
        <img class="da2" src="images/da2.png" alt="Mandlebulb 3 Image">
        <p>Mandelbulb 3D is a free software application created for 3D fractal imaging. The Mandelbulb is a three-dimensional fractal,
          constructed by Daniel White and Paul Nylander using spherical coordinates in 2009. A canonical 3-dimensional Mandelbrot set
          does not exist, since there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional space of complex numbers.</p>
